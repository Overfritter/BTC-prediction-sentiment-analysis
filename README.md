# **Bitcoin price prediction using financial sentiment analysis by GPT-models**

This repository contains code to perform financial sentiment analysis using OpenAI's ChatGPT, as well as predictive modeling using time series cross-validation (TSCV) and linear regression techniques. Additionally, you will find exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts to better understand the dataset and sentiment score trends.



### The repository is organized as follows:

sentiment_analysis/: Contains the code to perform sentiment analysis on Tweets using ChatGPT. This includes scripts to send batch requests to the OpenAI API and process the sentiment scores.

btc_price_prediction/: Houses the linear regression models that use Time Series Cross-Validation (TSCV) to predict Bitcoin prices based on the sentiment scores generated from the sentiment analysis.

eda/: Includes scripts for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to help you understand the data, visualize trends, and gain insights from the sentiment scores and Bitcoin price data.

data/: This directory contains the datasets used in the analysis, such as historical Bitcoin prices and sentiment scores.
